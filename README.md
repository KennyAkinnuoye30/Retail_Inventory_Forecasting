# Retail Inventory Forecasting Project

## Overview
Accurate inventory forecasting is critical for retail operations, directly impacting revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This project focuses on building a data-driven approach to forecasting retail inventory demand using historical sales data, with the goal of minimizing stockouts while avoiding excess inventory.

The work emphasizes sound analytical practices, clear assumptions, and reproducible modeling workflows. While the initial scope focuses on baseline forecasting, the project is designed to support iterative improvement and extension into more advanced modeling techniques.

## Problem Statement
Retailers often struggle to balance inventory levels due to:
- Demand volatility
- Seasonal purchasing behavior
- Delayed or incomplete visibility into sales trends

Over-forecasting leads to excess inventory and increased holding costs, while under-forecasting results in lost sales and poor customer experience. This project addresses these challenges by analyzing historical sales patterns and developing forecasting models that can support more informed inventory decisions.

## Objectives
- Understand historical sales and demand behavior
- Identify trends, seasonality, and irregular demand patterns
- Build baseline and comparative forecasting models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate error metrics
- Generate actionable insights for inventory planning

---

## Analytical Approach
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning and standardizing historical sales data
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Ensuring time series consistency

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Trend analysis across time
   - Seasonal and cyclical behavior
   - Demand variability at different aggregation levels

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Time-based features (day, week, month, seasonality indicators)
   - Lagged variables and rolling statistics
   - Business-relevant signals derived from historical behavior

4. **Forecasting & Modeling**
   - Baseline statistical forecasts for benchmarking
   - Comparative modeling approaches where applicable
   - Emphasis on interpretability and reliability

5. **Evaluation**
   - Performance comparison using forecast error metrics
   - Assessment of stability and practical usability
   - Identification of tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation and analysis
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and reproducibility

---

## Key Outcomes
- Clear visibility into historical demand patterns
- A structured forecasting workflow suitable for iteration
- Baseline performance benchmarks for future model improvements
- A foundation for extending the analysis into more advanced forecasting methods

---

## Current Status
🚧 In progress  
Initial data preparation and exploratory analysis are complete, with baseline forecasting models under active development.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporation of external signals (promotions, holidays, pricing changes)
- Evaluation of advanced time-series and machine learning models
- Scenario analysis to support inventory planning decisions
- Visualization of forecasts for stakeholder-friendly interpretation
