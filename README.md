# Retail Inventory Forecasting Project

## Overview
Accurate inventory forecasting is a core analytical challenge in retail, directly affecting revenue, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. This project delivers a **predictive, data-driven inventory forecasting solution** built using historical sales data to estimate future demand and support inventory planning decisions.

The project emphasizes **sound analytical methodology**, clear assumptions, and a **reproducible modeling workflow**. It culminates in the development and evaluation of forecasting models that quantify demand patterns and provide actionable insights for inventory management.

## Problem Statement
Retailers must continuously balance inventory levels in the presence of:
- Demand volatility  
- Seasonal purchasing behavior  
- Limited forward visibility into customer demand  

Over-forecasting increases holding and carrying costs, while under-forecasting results in stockouts and lost revenue. This project addresses these challenges by **analyzing historical sales patterns and building predictive forecasting models** that estimate future demand with measurable accuracy.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to understand demand behavior  
- Identify trends, seasonality, and demand variability  
- Engineer time-based and lagged features relevant to forecasting  
- Build and compare predictive forecasting models  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate error metrics  
- Translate model outputs into inventory-relevant insights

## Analytical Approach

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized historical sales data  
- Addressed missing values and anomalies  
- Ensured consistent time-series structure and granularity  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified long-term trends and seasonal effects  
- Analyzed demand volatility across time periods  
- Assessed distributional characteristics and outliers  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created time-based features (day, week, month indicators)  
- Generated lagged variables and rolling statistics  
- Encoded signals relevant to short-term and medium-term demand behavior  

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Developed **baseline forecasting models** to establish performance benchmarks  
- Implemented **predictive demand forecasts** using historical patterns  
- Prioritized interpretability, stability, and business relevance  

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated forecast accuracy using standard error metrics  
- Compared model performance against baseline benchmarks  
- Assessed practical tradeoffs between accuracy and model complexity

## Project Status
✅ **Completed**

All planned analysis, modeling, and evaluation steps have been finalized. The project represents a complete, end-to-end forecasting workflow suitable for portfolio demonstration.

---

## Potential Extensions
- Incorporating external drivers (promotions, holidays, pricing changes)  
- Testing advanced time-series or machine learning forecasting models  
- Scenario-based forecasting for inventory risk analysis  
- Visualization of forecast outputs for stakeholder consumption
